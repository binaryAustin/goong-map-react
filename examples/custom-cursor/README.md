# Example: Custom Cursor

This example showcases how to dynamically change the cursor over the map based on interactivity.

## Usage

To run this example, you need a [Goong Maptiles Key](https://account.goong.io). You can either set it as `GOONG_MAPTILES_KEY` in `src/app.js`, or set a `GoongAccessToken` environment variable in the command line.

```bash
npm i
npm run start
```
